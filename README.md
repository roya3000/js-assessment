This repo includes a set of tests that can be used to assess the skills of
a candidate for a JavaScript position, or to improve one's own skills.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test
